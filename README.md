### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m not so much active in open-source at the moment, am up for collaboration though! I am reading a lot of books! I am passionate about discussions on data structure, especially the history, SQL lite Richard Hipp, the rise of JSON over XML parsers, spotify's consolidation into one CI/CD pipeline and more. Feel free to ping me or set up a meet :)
