### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deploying an app, trying to get my head around Kubernetes. I worked as a Gsoc 2020 student @[Blender](https://www.blender.org/). ðŸŒ± Currently I am learning some Finance concepts as part of my curriculum.

- You can find more about my Blender work [here](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HimanshiKalra/Report)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshi-kalra-306712171/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I took my science book with me to the bathroom to study Archimedes Principle.
