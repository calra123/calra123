### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Thesis Project, BGP Anomaly Detection. I worked as a Gsoc 2020 student @[Blender Foundation](https://www.blender.org/). ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to start with GraphQL, and combine it with Flask and Data visualization with Plotly and Dash.

- You can find more about my Blender work [here](https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/User:HimanshiKalra/Report)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshi-kalra-306712171/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I took my science book with me to the bathroom to study Archimedes Principle.
